# Digits Classification on MNIST data using Logisitic Regression
Implemeneted Logisitic Regression from scratch for digits classification on MNIST dataset. 

Implemented Binary Classification of whether a number is 8 or 9 and Multinomial Classification. Used both Stochastic Gradient Descent and Mini Batch Gradient Descent for Binary Classification to compare their performances with respect to different learning rates. Mini Batch Gradient Descent is used for Multinomial Classification
